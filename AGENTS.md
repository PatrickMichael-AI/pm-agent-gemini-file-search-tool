# Gemini File Search Tool – Agent Guidelines

## Project overview
- Voice AI Knowledge Base Tool, used to search for information in a knowledge base, in response to a user's query.
- The purpose is to replace services such as Make.com and n8n.
- The @PM_KB_external_tutorial.blueprint.json file is a make.com blueprint that uses the Gemini File Search Tool to search for information in a knowledge base. We want to replicate this functionality in a new tool.
